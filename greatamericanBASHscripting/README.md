### I like to script in BASH.
One time I wrote a script that cloned servers for the purpose of selling subscription plan websites for political campaigns, so that they wouldn't have to be manually cloned every time we needed a new one; and I think that's the tops.

These are a few of my favorite  things.
Feel free to take a look around and use what you need.
