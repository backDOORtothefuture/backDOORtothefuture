Ina Beans is a script in progress, intented to be used with Snort (https://snort.org/) log files.

Right now it only counts the instanced of discovered IP's and has a single flag, -H, which attempts to locate common HTTP and HTTPS ports 80 and 443.

The goal is to make it a useful tool for discovering patterns within Snort log files, for easier threat/intrusion detection.
