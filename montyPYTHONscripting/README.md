### I like to script in PYTHON.
Have you ever written scripts to interact with programs that you use, so you don't have to manually do everything yourself? Like sending NMAP and TCPDUMP data into a program that can use it to detect issues and threats? You should. It's fun.

These are a few of my favorite  things.
Feel free to take a look around and use what you need.
